<h2>THE NEW HOME.</h2>


<p><span class = "firstletter">
<img src = "images/img_letter_t.png" width = "45" height = "45"
alt = "T"></img></span>he founding of a new home
marks an important era in a
human life. Whether you be
poor or wealthy, wise or ignorant, it is
all the same&mdash;you begin a new existence.
The associations of childhood and youth
now undergo a total change. The familiar
scenes disappear suddenly. Longfellow,
in his "Hanging of the Crane,"
writes the following touching words on
the eventful day:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <span class="i0">"O fortunate, O happy day,<br /></span>
    <span class="i0">When a new household finds its place<br /></span>
    <span class="i0">Among the myriad homes of earth,<br /></span>
    <span class="i0">Like a new star sprung to birth,<br /></span>
    <span class="i0">And rolled on its harmonious way<br /></span>
    <span class="i0">Into the boundless realms of space!"<br /></span>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <span class="i0"><b>. . . . .</b><br /></span>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
    <span class="i0">"For two alone, there in the hall,<br /></span>
    <span class="i0">Is spread the table round and small;<br /></span>
    <span class="i0">Upon the polished silver shine<br /></span>
    <span class="i0">The evening lamps; but, more divine,<br /></span>
    <span class="i0">The light of love shines over all;<br /></span>
    <span class="i0">Of love that says not mine and thine,<br /></span>
    <span class="i0">But ours, for ours is thine and mine."<br /></span>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <span class="i0"><b>. . . . .</b><br /></span>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <span class="i0">"They want no guests; they needs must be<br /></span>
    <span class="i0">Each other's own best company."<br /></span>
  </div>
</div>

<p>What sort of a home shall the new
one be? Shall it be the abode of
happy hearts and pure and noble lives,
or shall discontent and misery prevail?
Jane Welch Carlyle says truly: "If
ever one is to pray&mdash;if ever one is to
feel grave and anxious&mdash;if ever one is
to shrink from vain show and vain
babble&mdash;surely it is just on the occasion
of two human beings binding themselves
to one another, for better and
for worse, till death part them."</p>

<p>Great is the difference in households.
As one walks along a beautiful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
street in a city there is nothing in the
fronts of the houses to indicate the
kind of life which passes within doors.
But an intimate acquaintance, such as
a faithful pastor gains in the course of
his labors, often reveals the fact that in
some of the most magnificent houses
there is no peace or joy, while in some
of the humblest cottages there is a
calm and loving spirit which continues
and grows from year to year.</p>

<p>The kind of a house, even the adornments
which wealth and luxury bring,
do not determine the true home. The
two people who establish the new
household decide its quality.</p>

<p>That the people who occupy a
home decide its quality is beautifully
expressed by Nathaniel Cotton, a poet
of the last century:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"If solid happiness we prize,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within our breast this jewel lies;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And they are fools who roam:<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The world has nothing to bestow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From our own selves our joys must flow,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And that dear hut, our home."<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>If those who occupy the home resolve
to be happy and contented, to
avoid envying persons of larger means
and higher social position, to lead a
life of mutual confidence and esteem,
and to serve God with trustful love,
their home will be to them a sacred
place. I was once pastor of a church
in Fulton Street, Elizabeth, N. J., where
the most of the members were mechanics
and laborers and on the railroad.
Their circumstances were limited,
and they had but little power to
adorn their houses. But in some of
those homes there reigned such beauty
of spirit, such contentment with the
condition in life, such kindliness and
sympathy, such cheerfulness and patience,
that it was a joy to cross the
threshold and commune with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
members of the plain and unambitious
families. The memories of those visits
are among the most delightful of my
pastoral experience.</p>

<p>Suppose, then, your new home is
plain and homely. Remember, that
marble walls, and broad and polished
halls, and masterpieces in painting on
the walls, and a daily fare of luxuries,
and table service of silver and gold, and
a retinue of liveried servants do not
constitute a home. Though the new
home consist of only a few rooms, if mutual
love and admiration reign within
the narrow walls, no historical palace
can be half so beautiful or attractive.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Home's not merely four square walls,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Though hung with pictures nicely gilded;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Home is where affection calls,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Filled with shrines the heart hath builded.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><b>. . . . .</b><br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Home's not merely roof and room;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Home needs something to endear it;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Home is where the heart can bloom,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where there's some kind heart to cheer it."<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>
<p class="lastpara">But for a home to be truly beautiful
there must needs be, always, one guest&mdash;the
Saviour. There were many
magnificent buildings in Jerusalem
when He walked its streets and performed
his miraculous works of healing.
But in all the land, and in all the
ages, there was never one more charming
than that little home in Bethany,
where Lazarus and his sisters Mary
and Martha constituted the household.
And why was that the perfect home?
Because our Lord was always the welcome
Guest.</p>

<p><span class = "firstletter">
<img src = "images/img_letter_e.png" width = "45" height = "45"
alt = "E"></img></span>very thing depends on
the way you begin your new life
in your own new home. The
household altar is a supreme necessity.
No hesitation or timidity should be allowed
to prevent family worship. If
both of you are members of the Church,
the holding of a brief family worship
need not be a serious trial. The difficulty
will be when only one is a Christian,
and still greater will it be if neither
is a Christian. What is to be done under
such circumstances? Must the having
family worship be postponed until the
religious life be commenced? That is
uncertain, and it may be years before
a household altar is established. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
only safe way is to begin at once by
holding a short service. Simple it may
be. It was the daily custom of President
Hayes, during his presidential
term of office, to convene his family
for daily worship. The prayer consisted
of only the Lord's Prayer. But
it was enough. The minds of the
household were directed toward spiritual
things. The help of God was
sought, to bear whatever burdens the
day might bring.</p>

<p>However great the embarrassment
in the face of this great duty, let it not
prevent the brief domestic worship.
Begin&mdash;begin immediately. A short
Scripture reading, followed by prayer,
even only the Lord's Prayer, will be
sufficient. There are good forms of
prayer, some of which I have used to
advantage. Fletcher's <i>Family Devotion</i>;
Sturm's <i>Family Devotions</i>; Morison's
<i>Family Prayers</i>; Cumming's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
<i>Daily Family Devotion</i>; <i>Family Worship</i>,
by one hundred and eighty clergymen
of the Church of Scotland;
Cassell's <i>Family Devotion</i>; Dale's <i>Domestic
Liturgy</i>; Thornton's <i>Family
Prayers</i>; Thompson and Spurgeon's
<i>Home Worship and the Use of the
Bible in the Home</i>; and Jay's <i>Morning
and Evening Exercises</i>, are good
books for this purpose. The works
of Fletcher, Thornton, and the <i>Home
Worship</i> of Thompson and Spurgeon
are worthy of special commendation.
Even when one is accustomed to
extemporaneous prayer, the use of
one of the above books will, nevertheless,
be of great service in preventing
stereotyped phrases and trains of
thought. I have often found that my
own needs, and I believe those of my
family, have been better and more exactly
described by others than by myself.
It is best, however, to get into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
no fixed form. Let the extemporaneous
prayer, or the printed form of
prayer, be used judiciously, as circumstances
require.</p>

<p>Care should be taken that the home
worship may not be made tedious, and
thus become a burden. I have always
found it best to use the Bible for the
Scripture selection rather than the selections
made in the books containing
forms of prayer. It is well to read the
Bible in course, and to have <i>the same
copy of the Bible</i> from which to read
brief selections, without being governed
by the divisions in chapters.
Your one and the same Bible, being
used every day in family worship, becomes
very precious with the growing
years. It will be associated with all
the tenderest memories of the home
life. I have occasionally used a different
copy of the Bible in my own
home for family worship, but none is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
half so dear as the plain, old, and
well-worn copy with which I began,
when I established my own home altar,
far back in the years.</p>

<p>But, besides worship together at the
family altar, there should be private
prayer. Every one should have a
place where he can worship God
alone. Our Lord saw the necessity
that each of his disciples should be
alone with him. Hence he said:
"When thou prayest, enter into thy
closet, and when thou hast shut thy
door, pray to thy Father which is in
secret; and thy Father which seeth in
secret shall reward thee openly." Begin
the day by solitary communing
with God. End the day in the same
way, by asking God for his forgiveness
for the past, for his preservation for
the night, and for his care in all the
time to come.</p>

<p>But some one may say: "Does not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
this attention to religious duties make
the new home gloomy?" Not at all.
It is the way to make it bright and
cheerful. The wedding day soon
passes by, and in time will come the
regular domestic life, with its monotony
and cares. Leave this life to
God's ordering. He alone can make
us strong for every hour's demands.
The German poet Schirmer says a
wise word, which well applies to all
who begin life in the new home:</p>

<p class="lastpara">Vinet here lays down the true principle
of a thoroughly good life at
home: "Wherever we advance in the
path of marriage and of life, with eyes
lifted up toward a Saviour we love,
with a salvation we hope for, with a
spirit of prayer and supplication
through which Jesus Christ constantly
intervenes by his Spirit between the
husband and wife&mdash;there, indeed, a
marriage may be happy; nay, must be
infallibly so. The union between two
converted hearts is necessarily sweet
and unutterable; without this there is
no security." The new home consecrated
by prayer&mdash;daily prayer&mdash;will
become what that beautiful home of
Sir Thomas More was&mdash;"a school and
exercise of the Christian religion."</p>



<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page_28" id="page_28">[28]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE HOME BEAUTIFUL.</h2>


<p><span class = "firstletter">
<img src = "images/img_letter_g.png" width = "45" height = "45"
alt = "G"></img></span>reat art is required in making
beautiful the new home.
The house need not be large
and stately in order to be attractive to
the eye. More attention has been paid
of late in this country to the adornment
of homes than in former years. We
Americans begin to see, as never before,
that the enjoyment of the occupants of
a house is in some way connected with
the furnishing and general effect. Let
every room be used. Let the inner
doors be kept wide open. In this way
the atmosphere will be uniform and of
free circulation; the interior of the
house will appear to its full size, and
the general effect will be more cheerful.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Even the humblest means need not
prevent some simple hangings and a
few prints on the walls.</p>

<p>I would let the sunlight pour into
the new home. The old dread that the
carpets will get faded and the curtains
get spoiled is an abomination. My
own habit is, so soon as I get down
stairs in the morning&mdash;and I am an
early riser&mdash;to draw aside the curtains,
to let the shades fly up, and to throw
the sashes wide open. By and by, if
from the street this airy appearance is
considered a little unfashionable, and
those within choose to shut out the
sunlight in a measure, I rejoice that I
have had my unfashionable way, and the
sun has had his golden way, for a while
at least. Gladness comes into the house
with the blaze of the blessed sun. Let
all the rooms share the joy. I suppose
a carpet somewhat faded will wear as
long as if the colors were fresh. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
if the penalty for having bright and
sunny rooms is to be some faded carpets
and window hangings, let the full
penalty be paid, and cheerfully, too.
No price is too great for a bright and
sunny home.</p>

<p>The sight of a few flowers adds to
the beauty of even the humblest home.
Even a sprig of arbutus or jessamine,
or a lily of the valley, on the table, will
make every meal the sweeter. The
Germans of the poorest class, all over
the Fatherland, never forget to have
flowers in their lowly homes. If the
family occupy only a few rooms in a
lofty story, they will be sure to have
beautiful plants on the window-ledge,
and here and there within the rooms.
These are of such kind that the succession
of flowers is well kept up in all
seasons. Throughout the year, when
there is no frost, these flowering plants
at the German windows can be seen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
from the street to the highest flat.
The varied flowers and the hanging
vines form beautiful pictures in village
and town.</p>

<p class="lastpara">Away with the thought that wealth
is needed to make the home beautiful!
It is a question of taste, tact, and a desire
to please another. On the very
street where I live there is a quiet little
house, occupied by a newly-married
couple. It is inexpensive, and the
furniture is not costly. But there is
so much taste in the furnishing and
ornamentation, and there is so much
brightness in all the rooms, that the
home is a charming picture. I seldom
pass it without thinking of the beautiful,
but not costly, interior.</p>



<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page_32" id="page_32">[32]</a></span></p>
<h2>GOOD READING AT HOME.</h2>

<p><span class = "firstletter">
<img src = "images/img_letter_a.png" width = "45" height = "45"
alt = "A"></img></span>&nbsp;home without books is a
desert. In these days all the
standard authors can be bought
at small price, and even the humblest
home should be adorned with the companionship
of at least some of them.
You may not have a taste for reading;
at any rate, you may think you have not.
But possibly you have made a mistake
in the kind of books you have tried to
enjoy, and so imagined that you do not
like any books. Try another class, and
you will likely be surprised to find that
you can enjoy them. Suppose you
have not the experience to select proper
books. Now, you will have a pastor,
of course, and a church home. Make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
a friend of that pastor. He ought to
be a good adviser in the matter of
proper books. At any rate, get some
judicious friend to help you in the
choice. Buy only a very few books at
a time, and let your little home-library
grow gradually. Never buy a book
that you have your doubts about. Emerson's
advice to buy only a standard
work, which has been out for years,
has its good and safe quality. Avoid
too much fiction and a superabundance
of periodical literature. One popular
magazine is enough. The money which
you have for reading-matter should be
confined chiefly to books, and they
ought to be the world's masterpieces.</p>

<p>I am satisfied that in the average
home there is too little reading. History,
biography, travel, with a fair share
of religious books, can be read in course
at home, in the odd half hours, and the
mind become richly stored with facts.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Is there any thing in the domestic life
which ought to interfere with this constant
culture of the mind? Not at all.
The domestic life is highly favorable to
mental discipline. The very beginning
of real intellectual improvement in
many a mind has been in the new home
of persons just married. The reading
aloud of an interesting work, the one
to the other, is a delightful entertainment,
and gives a new charm to life.
Every effort must be employed to keep
the mind from becoming sluggish and
barren. We need information, the
thoughts of the good and great and
richly endowed, to make our own lives
richer.</p>

<p>It would be a wise arrangement if
every man and woman, on establishing
their home, would set apart some time
for intellectual improvement by the
reading of good books. I am acquainted
with a young lady, who, on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
entering her plain little house, found
that her husband and herself were so
interrupted by visits and other claims
on their time in the evening, that they
resolved to rise an hour earlier in the
morning, and devote the time to reading
and study. They were thus free
from interruption, and had ample opportunity,
before the regular duties of
the day began, to store their minds
with useful knowledge. I think it probable
that they will carry this excellent
custom with them through life.</p>

<p>Much of my time is spent in high-ways,
and along the narrow by-ways of
life. My homes are many. But when
my good fortune brings me at night to
occupy a room far from my own home,
where a good book or two are to be
found, I can say with Milton, in his
<i>Areopagitica</i>: "A good book is the precious
life-blood of a master-spirit embalmed
and treasured up on purpose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
to a life beyond;" and with Wordsworth,
in his "Personal Talk":</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Dreams, books, are each a world; and books, we know,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Are a substantial world, both pure and good;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Round these, with tendrils strong as flesh and blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our pastime and our happiness will grow."<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="lastpara">I like a home where you can see the
books. A choice book-case with glass
doors, and the doors locked, ought to
be expelled from the home. Let the
books be where they can be seen and
easily reached. Let them not be confined
to one room, but so distributed
that nearly every room shall have at
least a few in sight. A few books here
and there about the house, and even in
the bed-rooms, are worth more than a
costly piece of furniture. When we
see books in our homes, and they are
where we can handle them without effort,
we are apt to take them up, and
get snatches of good reading.</p>



<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page_37" id="page_37">[37]</a></span></p>
<h2>FORBEARANCE.</h2>


<p><span class = "firstletter">
<img src = "images/img_letter_t.png" width = "45" height = "45"
alt = "T"></img></span>he marriage bond is sacred. It
lasts for life: "Until death do
us part." But it is probable
that qualities of temperament and mind
in each one will develop which will surprise
the other. Some of these may produce
an unfavorable impression. Others
may prove most agreeable surprises.
Each person has come from a different
class of associations, and each has a different
nature. Here comes in the great
necessity of accommodation and adaptation.
Too early and too much criticism
spoils many a home. "One silent,
both happy," is an old motto well worth
observing. But often a single appreciative
word will brighten the whole sky.
One of Franklin's plain phrases has its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
wise lesson: "As we must account for
every idle word, so we must for every
idle silence." Frederika Bremer says:
"Marriage has a morrow, and again a
morrow." You will need to bear with
each other, and to so act, each to the
other, that every day may be made
beautiful and happy, and the whole
future one of mutual and respectful
forbearance.</p>

<p>"Foolish to think," says Dr. A. P.
Peabody, "that the whole mutual life
can flow on like the early stream, without
a ripple or eddy. Home is a school,
a discipline whereby husband and wife
are to grow unto each other, getting
rid of their angularities, harmonizing
their peculiar characteristics, and more
and more becoming one in thought,
sympathy, and life. The true blessedness
of wedded souls is not insured by
a simple exchange of plighted faith.
It comes through and after many a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
self-denial, many a crucifixion of the
will, many a scourging of the resentment,
anger, pride, vanity, and passions
of the heart. It is true here, as in
other relations, that 'he who saveth his
life shall lose it, and he that loseth his
life shall save it.'"</p>

<p>Do not forget, then, that the life at
home has its severe tests. If it is not
an expected thing, it will be the unexpected
which will try your nature and
make your burden heavy. You should
remember, if there is fault, that it is not
all on one side. The unkind word
may come to the lips, but it should
never be spoken.</p>

<p>The graces of patience, sublime calmness,
golden silence, should be cultivated
with delightful zeal. You may
each have had your way, but now the
way of another must be respected. Besides,
it may be a much better and safer
way than yours. John Angell James
says: "Where both have infirmities,
and they are so constantly together,
innumerable occasions will be furnished,
if we are eager, or even willing,
to avail ourselves of the opportunities
for those contentions which, if they do
not produce a permanent suppression
of love, lead to its temporary interruption.
Many things we should connive
at, others we should pass by with
an unprovoked mind, and in all things
most carefully avoid even what at
first may seem to be an innocent disputation."</p>

<p>The real basis of adaptation is mutual
respect and love. Neither the hus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>band
nor the wife must judge each
other too critically. The indiscreet
word, or error of any kind, must never
be allowed to cause a doubt as to the
heart's deep affection. Gentleness, patience,
time, will give ample opportunity
for the full sunlight to break forth.
Each heart needs the other for true
happiness. It must be a united life.
In "Hiawatha" we read the true relation:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"As unto the bow the cord is,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So unto the man is woman,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though she bends him, she obeys him;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though she draws him, yet she follows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Useless each without the other."<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The married life, to be supremely
happy, must be thoroughly unselfish. I
was once on shipboard with a tourist
who was accompanied by his wife, but
for whose opinion he seemed, even to
other travelers, to show but little respect.
The voyage was a long one,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
and while the wife's bearing was most
gentle and kindly, his manner impressed
me as thoroughly selfish. I
do not imagine that he was aware of
the abrupt and strongly personal quality
of his bearing toward his refined
and cultured wife. With all his wealth
he lacked that appearance of tenderness
which is more than gold or precious
stones.</p>

<p>No effort must be spared by either
husband or wife to contribute to the
other's happiness and comfort. It does
not require a long time, especially when
living together, for one to see what will
please another. This desire to please,
strengthening with the days and years,
revealing itself in a thousand kindly
ways, will do more than any thing else
to make the home a paradise on earth.</p>

<p>Cowper gives the true secret of a
beautiful and strengthening reciprocal
adaptation:</p>

<p class="lastpara">I believe the Germans excel all
others in literature in their warm tributes
to the faithful love and devotion
of their wives. Kerner, the Suabian
author, said this beautiful word in testimony
of his wife after their long years
of happiness together: "She hath borne
with me." Martin Luther said of his
wife, the devoted Catherine: "I would
not exchange my poverty with her for
all the riches of Cr&oelig;sus without her."
Bismarck, the man of "blood and iron,"
says of his wife: "She it is who made
me what I am."</p>

Our conduct at home
should be such that the morrow
will bring no regrets. Mrs. Sigourney
thus describes the changes that must
come over the brightest home:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Not for the summer's hour alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When skies resplendent shine<br /></span>

</div>
</div>

<p>It is sad enough when either a man
or his wife learns first, when one or
the other is taken away by death, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
there has been a life-long want of considerate
tenderness.</p>

<p>Supposing the late Thomas Carlyle
had been a little more attentive to his
brilliant and devoted wife during their
long and lonely life in the plain home
in Cheyne Row, in Chelsea, London,
such words as these, which escaped
her in a letter to a friend, could never
have been said: "Those little attentions
which we women attach so much
importance to he was never in the
habit of rendering to any one; his upbringing,
and the severe turn of mind
he has from nature, had alike indisposed
him toward them."</p>

<p>But the grim old man saw his mistake
at last. It was all too late, however.
It was only after all her sacrifices
had been made, and he had
written his many works, and she lay in
her grave, that he awoke to a knowledge
of his long neglect. Mr. Froude<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
says that Carlyle often said, when there
was no more opportunity for a kind
word to reach his wife: "O if I could
but see her for five minutes, to assure
her that I really cared for her throughout
all that; but she never knew it,
she never knew it." It is no wonder
that Mr. Froude was compelled to
write of Carlyle these sad words: "For
many years after she had left him,
when he passed the spot where she was
last seen alive he would bare his gray
head in the wind and rain, his features
wrung with unavailing sorrow."</p>

<p>We are prone to take too many
things for granted. You should not assume
that your thoughtless word, or
harsh manner, or forgetfulness of little
and delicate attentions will have no
effect, and will be duly passed by as
unmeaning. No such thing! Every
word or look which is incompatible
with genuine love and respect weighs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
like a millstone. Gentle attentions
will be remembered, not only through
the day, but through all the days. Recently,
while on a visit in Irvington-on-the-Hudson,
the widow of a celebrated
publisher led me to the portrait of her
lamented husband, and stood in admiration
before the magnificent painting.
She then said to me: "I esteem it the
greatest honor that could be conferred
upon me to have been the wife of such
a man." Could there be a grander tribute
to an attentive and devoted husband?</p>

<p>In that exquisite work, <i>Memorials
of a Quiet Life</i>, Mrs. Hare pays this
beautiful tribute to her husband: "I
never saw any body so easy to live
with, by whom the daily petty things
of life were passed over so lightly; and
then there is a charm in the <i>refinement</i>
of feeling which is not to be told in its
influence upon trifles." Mrs. Stowe, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
describing the good qualities of the
Duchess of Sutherland in her own
home in Scotland, says that she excelled
in <i>considerateness</i>. Paul's advice
is as beautiful as it is true, and suits
young married people perfectly. In
the Revised Version it reads thus:
"In lowliness of mind each counting
other better than himself; not looking
each of you to his own things, but each
of you also to the things of others."
Another piece of Pauline advice is of
equally useful quality: "Let us therefore
follow after the things which make
for peace, and things wherewith one
may edify another."</p>

<p class="lastpara">Happy are they whom death has not
yet divided, and to whom it is still
granted to say such words and do such
kindly acts as will prove delightful
memories when the Happy To-Days
become only Yesterdays in the Home.</p>
